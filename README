Recent financial websites allows one to download statements in easily readable format, e.g., csv.  This means one can easily cross-check accounts for consistency.  I personally use MoneyDroid which allows transactions to be explored in sqlite database.  This set of scripts is created for my own needs.  If you find it useful, go ahead.  However this comes as-in without guarantees.  I am not responsible for your finance.  Good luck.
