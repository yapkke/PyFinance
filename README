Recent financial websites allows one to download statements in easily
readable format, e.g., csv.  This means one can easily cross-check
accounts for consistency.  I personally use MoneyDroid which allows
transactions to be explored in sqlite database.  This set of scripts
is created for my own needs.  If you find this useful, go ahead.
